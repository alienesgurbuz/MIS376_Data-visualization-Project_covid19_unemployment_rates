# Impact of Covid 19 on Unemployment
# Abstract
The new coronavirus came to the fore for the first time on December 31, 2019, when it was announced that signs of lung infection were detected in 4 people working in a market selling seafood and live animals in Wuhan, China, and in many people who visited this market on the same days. With their long-term effects, pandemics leave indelible scars on society's memories. Beyond being a cause of disease or death, they can have a variety of effects, the most important of which are psychological, social, and economic.

# Description of the Problem
As everyone knows, Covid-19 has a huge impact on all of our lives. People of all kinds and professions were affected by this negative effect, health workers, students, teachers, shopkeepers, workers.. Unemployment, which is considered not only as an economic phenomenon but also as a social phenomenon in today's societies, is one of the important social problems. Due to the quarantine brought by the pandemic, people were confined to their homes, trade was greatly reduced and many businesses suffered great losses. After these losses, many people went bankrupt and they had to close their businesses and they became unemployed. Unemployed people are not given enough attention in many countries, in fact, this is a very important problem. Maybe the corona did not kill the people who were unemployed due to the pandemic, but unemployment and livelihood did. Many people could not bear the stress and they committed suicide. Because working is not just a way of earning income, it is a way of life that enables people to realize themselves by increasing their self-confidence, and to feel social belonging by developing closer relations with the group they belong to. On the contrary, unemployment, which lowers the individual's standard of living and causes poverty, causes him to feel anger and anger towards himself and the society, to see himself as lonely and excluded from the society, to deteriorate his relations with other people causing a condition. Most countries have difficulty in finding a solution to this problem, because the economies of almost all countries have shrunk due to Covid-19 and countries have had to exhaust their resources. Of course, these figures were generally higher in underdeveloped and developing countries.Because developed and strong economies such as the USA, Canada and Germany were able to provide the necessary assistance to their unemployed citizens during the pandemic. Many countries, especially Turkey, did not help their citizens who had to close their workplaces due to quarantine bans, or the aid provided was very insufficient.

# Solution
In my opinion, it is very difficult to find a solution to this problem right now, because what is needed for the solution is money and the states should have foreseen them this scenario and allocated the necessary emergency funds for themselves. However, it is possible to find a solution to this problem now. First of all, studies in unemployment institutions should be increased and necessary analyzes should be done correctly. Although Covid-19 has caused unemployment in many sectors, new employment areas have also been opened. For example, shopping from e-commerce sites has increased greatly during the pandemic process, and the need for the number of employees in this field has also increased.

# Results
Unemployment is a global and difficult problem to solve. This problem seriously affects people's lives not only economically, but also sociologically and psychologically. This problem that affects people's lives to such a large extent, has peaked with Covid-19 and pandemic conditions, and unemployment has increased more than ever before. These difficult conditions have greatly affected people's lives, and states need to develop their policies to tackle these problems.

As a result of my research, I found that the sectors most affected negatively by unemployment in during the pandemic:

▪Entertainment Industry
concerts, theaters, cinemas, night entertainment venues

▪Tradesmen
barbers, cafe & restaurant owners, arcade places, 

▪Tourism Industry
swimming pools, hotels

▪Sports Industry
gyms, fan revenues in all sports branches of all teams

▪Airline Companies

▪Companies with a Global Distribution Network

▪Oil Companies


However, there were also growing sectors due to the coronavirus:

▪Disinfectant and Hygiene Products Manufacturers

▪Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Companies

▪Food Producers 

▪Social Media Companies
